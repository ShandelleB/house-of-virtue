		<h2>The House of Virtue Program</h2>
		<h4>The House of Virtue is a faith based ministry that follows God&rsquo;s guidance in love through Jesus.  Our purpose is to be a safe haven for women who are pregnant and to provide parenting education, one on one counseling, and life skills.  Prenatal care is started immediately upon entering the house.</h4>
		<h4>Each person in the program is required to attend bible classes, receive counseling and participate in work chores as a daily routine.  If a resident has present or previous drug addiction we require the resident to attend both Overcomers and Celebrate Recovery and a specialized horse and dog training class.  Also, GED classes are offered.</h4>
		<h4>If the resident stays with House of Virtue until after their baby is born, we endeavor to teach how to care for a new born and become a productive citizen.</h4>
		<h4>When the assignments are completed the resident is evaluated.  An exit interview is held to verify their ability to enter into society with a good biblical and parental knowledge obtaining the life skills needed to succeed.</h4>
